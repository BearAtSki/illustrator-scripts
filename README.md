# Scripts for Illustrator

This repo is for my personal collection of Illustrator scripts.

Some of these scripts were written by me, some of them written by other humans on the internet - and labeled accordingly.

### License
These scripts were originally made for my personal use, but thought someone might find them useful.

Use them, share them, enjoy them. They are FREE. Free as in Free Beer - use them responsibly.

Oh, and don't be a PooHead and try to sell them.
