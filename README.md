# Scripts for Illustrator

Welcome to my personal collection of useful Illustrator scripts.

Function over form - that's probably the best way to describe them, meaning my code might not be the best looking, or most logical approach, but It-Works‚Ñ¢.

## Swatch Group from Hexadecimal colors
Make Illustrator swatches from a series of HEX codes
There's a version with a Dialog window where you can paste in your hex codes and a "quick" version that takes the text from the clipboard.
Works great with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) links, CSS code from [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore) or any other text containing HEX codes.

 üìù [addSwatchGroup](./all%20them%20Scripts/addSwatchGroup.jsx) - with Dialog Window

 üìù [quickAddSwatchGroup](./all%20them%20Scripts/quickAddSwatchGroup.jsx) - without Dialog

## Gradient from Hex colors
Make Illustrator Gradient swatch from a series of HEX codes. </br>
Create a gradient with the [generator](https://www.learnui.design/tools/gradient-generator.html), copy the CSS code and run the script.

## Shear and Rotate
Found this gem on the [internet](http://sysys.blog.shinobi.jp/Entry/53/), a script to create non-destructive Shear using Transform Effects.
Most of the time I also rotate the objects at the shear angle, so added a checkbox for that, and translated the script to english.
Select the objects you want to shear and run the script.
